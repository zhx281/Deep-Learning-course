# Numpy models Directory

This directory contain modify projects written with python using the numpy library.

  	- This notebook is a demonstration of how to create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using the numpy library. The model contains multi fully-connected layers with ReLU activation between the layer and Sigmoid activation for the outputs layer to predict images to be cat or not cat.  

- [DNN_v2](https://github.com/zhx281/Deep-Learning-course/blob/master/numpy_models/DNN_v2.ipynb) or <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/zhx281/Deep-Learning-course/blob/master/numpy_models/DNN_v2.ipynb">

  	- This notebook is a demonstration of how to create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with different parameter initialization techniques, added option for L2 Regularization, and added option for Dropouts with only using the python numpy library. The model contains multi fully-connected layers with ReLU activation between the layer and Sigmoid activation for the outputs layer to predict images to be cat or not cat.
